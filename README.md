# The Last Stand

## About me

I had my first interaction with code in 2016. Since then I found it very interesting, nonetheless I didn't have the opportunity to study it continuosly because of my job. I am a laywer by profession but I found this to be more engaging, at least for me. In 2018 I decided to give it another shot and in 2019 I heard about the Ironhack Scholarship with Bitso. I applied to it and was selected. I am from Tampico, Tamaulipas an on the 3rd of January I left it all behind and came here to CDMX to start my path to become a Web Developer.

## Module 1 - Project Videogame

### The Last Stand

I love videogames and one of the first videogames I played was StarCraft. There was a mission where you needed to hold of the enemy for 30 minutes, so as my project for the ending of Module 1 I decided to recreate a simpler version of that game. 

### Story

You are a marine that needs to defend your base while it preprares to launch from the assault of the zerg for 150 seconds.

### Mechanics

The goal is to survive 150 seconds. Enemies will come from the right side on the screen with words associated with them. You need to write the words and press enter to kill them. If they reach your base, you lose 1 life. Lose all 3 and it is game over. Also, as time passes, enemies will spawn more often and with more difficult names.
